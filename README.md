GitHub / upload notes
- This repo is ready to be initialized and pushed to GitHub. I can initialize a git repo and create an initial commit locally for you.
- Tell me the desired GitHub repository name and whether you want it public or private. You can either provide an existing remote URL or let me attempt to create the GitHub repo using the `gh` CLI (if installed and authenticated).

If you prefer one repo per project instead of a single aggregate repo, tell me and I will adjust the steps.
