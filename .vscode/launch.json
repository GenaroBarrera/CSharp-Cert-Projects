//Next, Launch configurations 
/* You've already seen that Visual Studio Code uses the launch.json file to configure the debugger. If you're creating a
simple C# console application, it's likely that Visual Studio Code generates a launch.json file that has all of the
information you need to successfully debug your code. However, there are cases when you need to modify a launch
configuration, so it's important to understand the attributes of a launch configuration. */

Edit a launch configuration

There are lots of scenarios when you might need to customize the launch configuration file. Many of those scenarios
involve advanced or complex project scenarios. This module focuses on two simple scenarios when updating the launch
configuration file is required:

    Your C# console application reads input from the console.
    Your project workspace includes more than one application.*/
